            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Most youth sports allow officials as young as 12–14 years old, depending on the sport and the level of play. Younger officials typically start with lower-level games and work their way up as they gain experience and confidence. Adults of all ages are also welcome — it's never too late to start.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              No. Many of our officials started with zero experience. If you have a basic understanding of the sport and a willingness to learn, we can help connect you with the right training and get you ready for your first assignment.
            </div></div>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Gear varies by sport. Baseball umpires need dark pants, a polo or umpire shirt, a plate mask (for behind the plate), and an indicator. Basketball referees need the classic black-and-white striped shirt and black pants. We can point you to the right gear when you sign up — you don't need to figure it out on your own.

            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              GT Officials can connect you with clinics and training resources for your sport. Organizations like MYAS also run umpire clinics each spring that are great for beginners. In addition, you'll learn a lot simply by working games alongside more experienced officials. We'll make sure you're prepared before we send you out.

            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              <!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual pay ranges -->
              Pay varies by sport, game level, and your experience, but youth officials in the Twin Cities typically earn [$ – $ per game]. During peak season (summer for baseball, winter for basketball), active officials can work multiple games per week. It's a solid side income, and with GT Officials, you'll get paid quickly after every assignment.
            </div></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Game offers are sent through Arbiter, and you can see available assignments well in advance. You choose which games to accept based on your own availability — there's no minimum commitment. You set your own schedule.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Absolutely. We don't require exclusivity. Many of our officials work with multiple associations and assignors. Adding GT Officials to your list simply means more game opportunities and another reliable source of income.
            </div></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              <!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual payout timing -->
              Fast — it's what we're known for. GT Officials processes payouts [within X days / weekly / describe actual cadence] so you're not waiting around wondering when your check will arrive. We believe officials deserve to get paid promptly, and we make it a priority.
            </div></div>

          <div class="faq-item">

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              We use <strong>Arbiter</strong> (arbiter.io) — the industry-standard platform for officiating assignments. If you already have an Arbiter account, getting set up with GT Officials is seamless. If you don't have one yet, we'll help you create one. You can manage your schedule, accept/decline games, and track payments all from the Arbiter app on your phone.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              We cover the greater Twin Cities metro area — Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and surrounding suburbs. Game locations vary depending on the associations we work with, but the majority of assignments are within the metro. You can see the specific location of each game in Arbiter before you accept it.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Our primary sports are baseball and basketball. We also assign officials for softball, football, and soccer. If you're certified or experienced in multiple sports, that's even better — we can keep you busy across seasons.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              You pay GT Officials the full officiating fees for your games. We handle all individual payouts to officials from that amount. Pricing varies by sport, game level, and volume. Contact us for a quote based on your specific program — we're happy to put together a proposal.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              That's one of the biggest advantages of working with an assignor like GT Officials. We maintain a deep roster specifically so we can handle last-minute changes. If an official can't make it, we work our contacts to find a qualified replacement as quickly as possible. Your games are our responsibility.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              The earlier the better, but we understand that schedules change. Ideally, we'd have your schedule at least a few weeks in advance for regular season games. For tournaments, more lead time helps us ensure full coverage. We're flexible and accustomed to working with evolving schedules — just communicate changes as they happen and we'll adjust.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">
              Yes. We handle both regular season leagues and tournaments — from small weekend events to large multi-day tournaments with dozens of games. Tournament staffing requires more coordination, which is exactly the kind of work we excel at.
